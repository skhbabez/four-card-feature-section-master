## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE Design Principles

### What I learned

I focused especially on utilizing some of the techniques showcased in Andy Bell's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iluhx2QWJDQ) on good modern practices. I liked the idea of utilizing css variables and trying to do as much globally as possible, which I tried to implement in this project. I also challenged myself to use grid more this time, since overfocused on flex in my last submissions. Using grid areas made this especially clean and I will probably utilize grid a lot more from now on

```css
.grid {
  grid-template:
    "card1 card1"
    "card2 card3"
    "card4 card4";
}
```

### Continued development

I tend to be a little bit too perfectionist with these projects, focusiing too much on getting them to look exactly like the figma files. Bit i felt that this limited me here, not allowing me to explore some concepts. I want to experiment with creating responsive typescales and make my spacings more responsive in my next Projects, even if it means diverting a little from the figma files. I also want to look into css resets, maybe collecting the common resets i already did in past projects and create my own.
